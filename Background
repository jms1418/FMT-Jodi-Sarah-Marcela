Background
# We were interested in the effect that Fecal Microbiota Transplants (FMT) had on the wellbeing of individuals in need and the process that goes along with this variation of Microbiota Transfer Therapy (MTT). Kang & colleagues assessed the impact of FMT on the alteration of gut flora and subsequent improvements of gastointestinal (GI) symptoms in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). 
ASD is a complex neurobiological disorder that impairs social interactions and communication skills. These issues lead to repeptitive, restricted, and stereotypical patterns of behavior, interests, and activities of those affected. The cause of this spectrum of disorders is complex due to the interplay of gentic and environmental factors on the severity of symptoms. Due to this lack of straightforward explanations, there is no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) - approved pharmaceutical treatment to aid in the management of symptoms.
However, the gut microbiota of the individual affected is suspected to play a role in this disorder. People with ASD often suffer from GI issues such as consipation, diarrhea, or a combination of both phenomena. Interestingly, the severity of these GI anomalies is correlated with the severity of ASD symptoms. In those with increasingly severe ASD, a lower abundance of fermentative bacteria and a lower overall bacterial diversity has been observed. This creates a dysbiotic relationship between gut microbiota and issues in metabolite regulation, affecting GI functioning and correlating to general neurobiological conditions incuding anxiety.
