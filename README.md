Figure 1. Bar plot of the relative frequency of bacteria at taxonomic level 3 separated by the three sample collection types of the first sequence obtained from Kang et al. (2017). The plot was created using the reference table created on VScode on the RON computing cluster with the conda qiime2-2022.8 environment.

Figure 2. Bar plot of the relative frequency of bacteria at taxonomic level 3 separated by the two sample collection types of the second sequence obtained from Kang et al. (2017). The plot was created using the reference table created on VScode on the RON computing cluster with the conda qiime2-2022.8 environment.

Figure 3. Unweighted unifrac emporer PCA plot of bacteria separated by the sequence differences between the three sample collection types of the first sequence obtained from Kang et al. (2017). Shows three axes indicating the amount of difference between the sample collection types. The plot was created using the relative frequency table created on VScode on the RON computing cluster with the conda qiime2-2022.8 environment.

Figure 4. Unweighted unifrac emporer PCA plot of bacteria separated by the sequence differences between the two sample collection types of the second sequence obtained from Kang et al. (2017). Shows three axes indicating the respective amount of difference between the sample collection types. The plot was created using the relative frequency table created on VScode on the RON computing cluster with the conda qiime2-2022.8 environment.

Figure 5. Box plot of the diversity of the alpha diversity data and the three sample collection types of the first sequence obtained from Kang et al. (2017) based on the Shannon entropy measure. The plot was created using the shannon vector created on VScode and the sample metadata on the RON computing cluster with the conda qiime2-2022.8 environment.
